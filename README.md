# clipboard manager for cosmic

The goal is to make a simple yet fast clipboard history, with a focus on UX, rapidity and security.


Currently support storing the history on disk and get data from wayland.


Todo:
- search (using rayon)
- choose to copy one item from the clipboard
- image support
- Remove old entries
- ...


Maybe take inspiration on this gnome extension: https://github.com/oae/gnome-shell-pano
